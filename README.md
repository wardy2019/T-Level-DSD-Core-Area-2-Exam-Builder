# T Level Digital Software Development â€“ Core Content Area 2 Knowledge Library

This repository provides a **comprehensive knowledge base** for **Core Content Area 2: Introduction to Programming** from the T Level Digital Software Development qualification.

The aim is to give students and educators a **black-and-white revision document** that supports short-answer questions (SAQs) and long-answer questions (LAQs). It also provides a structured knowledge source for integration with GitHub Copilot agents.



## Contents

The knowledge base (in `index.html`) covers the following specification points:

- 2.1 Standard data types  
- 2.2 Variables and constants  
- 2.3 Data structures  
- 2.4 Operators  
- 2.5 Input and output  
- 2.6 Actions (sequence, selection, iteration)  
- 2.7 Functions and procedures  
- 2.8 Validation  
- 2.9 Design considerations and programming practices  
- 2.10 Robust code and debugging  
- 2.11 Common algorithms (searching and sorting)  
- 2.12 Testing  



## Features

- Clear **definitions, purposes, and when/why to use each concept**  
- **Worked Python examples** (PEP 8 compliant) for illustration  
- **Pitfalls** highlighting common mistakes to avoid  
- **Exam tips** aligned to assessment command words (*give, describe, explain, discuss, evaluate*)  
- Appendix with **glossary** and **quick syntax reference**  



## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in any web browser to access the knowledge base.  
2. Use the structured content to revise key programming theory and concepts.  
3. Link this resource into a GitHub Copilot agent knowledge library to generate **exam-style questions and answers**.
